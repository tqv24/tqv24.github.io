&lt;p>University is like a bus stop in front of the school gate. Get on, go, and then come back, starting a new semester again. Get on, go and never come back, then graduate&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The four-year journey with Bach Khoa in the role of a student has officially come to an end for me. Four years of youth, four years dedicated to Bach Khoa, more specifically, the months and days spent facing tight deadlines with comrades, friends, the moments of joy when receiving scholarships, and also the sorrows of losing a few things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, wearing the graduation gown, I believes that this is not just my own effort but also depends heavily on the care of family, the guidance of teachers, the support of siblings and friends, and the uncles and aunts within the relationships. And truly, there are no words to fully express, and no book can capture all the love that everyone has given to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore, on this occasion, I would like to express the most sincere gratitude to everyone who has helped and supported him throughout the challenging journey of growth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hopes to continue receiving love and trust from everyone and to accompany everyone in the upcoming journey full of ups and downs and challenges.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sincerely,&lt;br>

It is so widespread that even children who have just learned to read or write, and street vendors on the sidewalks, have likely heard and used it at least once. While each of us may have our own definition of self-learning, in terms of the concept, it can broadly be understood as &amp;ldquo;Self - Learning.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, what does &amp;ldquo;Self&amp;rdquo; mean? For me, &amp;ldquo;Self&amp;rdquo; encompasses several meanings: self-awareness, self-assessment, self-action, and self-pride. Self-awareness allows us to have a consciousness of studying, working on time, following schedules without procrastination or prolonged periods. Self-assessment helps us understand where we are, what position we are in, and how to continue striving scientifically and efficiently. Self-action means that we must take action for ourselves, seek what is necessary and beneficial, and start implementing it. Lastly, self-pride. Once we have gone through self-awareness, self-assessment, self-action, and achieved what we expected, we have the right to take pride in our accomplishments, in what we have, and what we have achieved. Perhaps these results are not perfect in the literal sense, but at least they reflect the process of our hard work, effort, and sweat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following &amp;ldquo;Self,&amp;rdquo; we have &amp;ldquo;Learning.&amp;rdquo; Why is it &amp;ldquo;Learning&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;Study,&amp;rdquo; or any compound nouns with the word &amp;ldquo;Learn-&amp;rdquo; at the forefront? From my perspective, &amp;ldquo;Learning&amp;rdquo; encompasses both &amp;ldquo;Study&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Practice.&amp;rdquo; During the &amp;ldquo;learning process,&amp;rdquo; we can easily encounter various learning methods: learning by doing (Studying), learning and then practicing applying what was taught (Learning by practice), observing others and learning from them (Learning by observation), &amp;hellip; But my friend, I am sure that, sooner or later, your learning process will encounter obstacles. And at that moment, I am confident that if you genuinely desire to study seriously from the beginning, you will start fervently seeking solutions to that problem immediately, right? At this point, the knowledge you have accumulated seems to be trapped in a box full of chaos, and what you need most at this time&amp;hellip; ask yourself&amp;hellip; is it &amp;ldquo;help&amp;rdquo; from someone to connect the chaos in your head? To be straightforward, do these questions and uncertainties become the final barrier preventing you from fully grasping knowledge? &amp;hellip; For that reason, from my point of view, &amp;ldquo;Learning&amp;rdquo; carries a more serious meaning to help us progress further, to have a deeper understanding of the knowledge we have learned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Integrating both concepts, &amp;ldquo;Self&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Learning,&amp;rdquo; we get a fresher concept, &amp;ldquo;Self-learning.&amp;rdquo; Based on the evidence presented above, we can easily see that &amp;ldquo;Self-learning&amp;rdquo; does not mean just focusing on devouring a textbook, doing a bunch of exercises, or forcing yourself to master all the essence of a subject. For me, &amp;ldquo;Self-learning&amp;rdquo; must be a process of seeking your own learning path. More clearly, &amp;ldquo;Self-learning&amp;rdquo; will include three steps. First, set for yourself a passion, a specific schedule of achievable goals corresponding to time frames (and of course, this is just an initial estimate). The second step is to follow the established principles. This step is the most difficult, easy to give up, and most easily distorted. However, if you can adhere to the principles set for a long enough time, it will become a habit that helps us have a persistent will and a stronger spirit. In this step, routine tasks will include: finding relevant materials and figuring out how to digest them, testing yourself with exercises, related practical tasks, trying every way to solve problems in your own way. And the final step is when we encounter a problem that we cannot find a solution to, or the solution we come up with does not satisfy us, this is the most appropriate time to seek help from: teachers, parents, friends, experts, blogs, forums, &amp;hellip; And then&amp;hellip; go back to the second step. With this three-step process, we can easily see that external help is part of the &amp;ldquo;Self-learning&amp;rdquo; process and does not violate the initial concepts of this process. Quite simply, to get help, we have to &amp;ldquo;Self&amp;rdquo; seek the right person who can guide us to solve the problem, and &amp;ldquo;Learning&amp;rdquo; learn from their solutions, their way of thinking. In that process, we have to know how to present our issues and know what help we need from them. In summary, self-learning and learning from external help, though two but one, and we cannot deny the individual benefits of each process. If you don&amp;rsquo;t self-learn and rely entirely on external help, soon enough, you will become dependent and conform to what is passed down. On the contrary, if you only self-learn without external help, we may fall into arrogance, self-satisfaction, and may lead to distortions in the knowledge acquired. Only when we harmoniously combine these two processes, creating a unified process, can we progress further, have the opportunity to interact, learn from various sources, and enrich our knowledge on our own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, the purpose of this article is just a momentary whimsy, and this is entirely my perspective. I do not hope to change people&amp;rsquo;s thinking, but on the contrary, I hope to provide a new and profound view of the two words &amp;ldquo;Self-learning&amp;rdquo; in practice from the perspective of my personal experience. I am open to feedback from everyone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Warm regards.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>For growing us</title><link>https://martinakaduc.github.io/post/for-growing-us/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Mar 2020 10:10:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martinakaduc.github.io/post/for-growing-us/</guid><description>&lt;p>Each of us was born and grow up by the laws of nature that no one can resist. In such a long and arduous journey, there must be many times we certainly face some traumas from this life. Perhaps they are falls, scars by carelessness, or the words and actions of others that immerse us in the despair about ourselves. On the path to becoming a true adult, we are continuously looking for solutions and answers for past traumas; but unintentionally, we hurt others. Others here are not strangers, they can be our families, friends, lovers, colleagues&amp;hellip; And thus, the injuries have not been healed, but increasingly spread out. This makes the growing-up journey more and more difficult. But anyway, you still have to grow up and find the right answer for your own life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have heard a quote like this “Strength of a person is shaped in his own weakness&amp;quot;. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what you think, but to me, growing up is a &amp;ldquo;thorn&amp;rdquo;. Why? I will tell you stories that you may have been the protagonists of:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You saw a dog growling, your mother tells you to stay away from it and draw scary scenes. So, you are afraid of dogs 🙂&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You asked to study an art subject that you like, but your family objected. And then your family praises another child with that talent.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The neighbor kid dropped in and took or broke an item that you like so much. And adults say it was okay.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Parents often say that you are lazy to exercise. But every time go out of the house for a little bit long, sure to hear their complaints.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You absolutely don’t like that boring math, but you must learn because 3 generations of your family are excellent doctors.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You are bullied by older children, but can&amp;rsquo;t tell anyone. Not because you don&amp;rsquo;t want to say it, but because you know that you&amp;rsquo;ll receive apologies at the most. You are too gentle!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Everyone expects you to pass that exam, but your result is not as expected even though you try your best. And people think that you have not tried enough although your learning conditions are far behind those who luckily pass.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The harsh truth is that there is no way to grow in sweetness. Growth is a path full of roses, but every rose has its thorns, the thorn is small but can tear all the courage in you, enough to make you fall, make you extremely disappointed. But you have to stand up and move on your own feet, heal the scratches printed for years in the depths of your soul. Only having passed by yourself, you can feel the beauty and sweet scent on each red rose petal, which is also what build up you at the present. The red color of flowers is your own sweat, tears and blood. It is the most practical evidence for the efforts you made to stand here today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do you know? One of the things that makes people more mature is a broken love. Even if today you cry your eyes out for someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t love you, the next day you still have to have a bright smile to welcome the sunrise. Because maturity is when you learn to love yourself. For a caterpillar, becoming a butterfly means going through extremely painful cocoons and molting. But after all, the used-to-be-ugly caterpillar has become a beautiful butterfly with all patterns on the wings. Can you see, in order to grow up, humans as well as caterpillar have to suffer pain and hurt to find a way to heal themselves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The fine line between children and adults is maturity. You can choose to be a child because children only have to eat, play, study and sleep. Adults are a somewhat better version than children because they have been battered many times, and after each fall, they stand up and move on, try to reach their goal on the chosen path. So adults may have a stronger mind, be able to make their own dreams come true - something that children cannot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although growing up means suffering, if not experiencing, an adult is just a child in an ageing body - an incomplete adult. Perhaps because maturity is a thorn that everyone gets at least one stab. But when you are young, any wound will be easier to heal, enthusiasm of life is brimful so you can stand up and go straight, youth is the brightest, wildest, most beautiful fire. It can be extinguished many times, but after each suppression it will flare up stronger.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We all know that traumas belong to individuals, but we can spread from person to person. For example, today your boss is unhappy because he just broke up with his girlfriend, and later unreasonable scolded you, although your report is very good. Then, you go home, because of that little frustration, you take it out on your family. In the end, your happiness cracked again. Do you see? Trauma though is not a serious infectious disease like COVID-2019, it also spreads very quickly and the consequences are also not so mild. Therefore, my buddies, if you are experiencing such situations, please have the most generous and sympathetic heart to understand and forgive them, don’t let yourself become a source of infection to others, it only makes you more deeply vulnerable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Creator always gives people the good things, please keep that in mind. But before you have those beautiful things, you absolutely must overcome the difficult frontier, that is growing up. And only when going through that difficult period, you can rediscover your true self, get answers to the questions that need answers in you. Hopefully, with all the available gentleness and honesty, you can face all ahead challenges, find the truth for your life and live by the person within you.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Be yourself</title><link>https://martinakaduc.github.io/post/be-yourself/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2020 10:10:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martinakaduc.github.io/post/be-yourself/</guid><description>&lt;p>By the time you realize that all the &amp;ldquo;more&amp;rdquo; in the world are just differences, there is no inferiority in level, able to live with what you like, and if you like something you will try to have it, not because anyone has it, but because you need it, that&amp;rsquo;s the time when you cross the line of envy and live your own life.&lt;/p>

Mentioning white color, most people think of children in pure white shirts going to school every day, or unblemished and spontaneous things like a 3-year-old kid’s soul. But it’s just the tip of the iceberg, white is an extreme obsession for those is suffering severe trauma. In Le Quynh Tran’s eyes, the scariest moment of white is when family affection has begun to be rifted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Love is like a tale&lt;br>
Father has long since not read.&lt;br>
Love is like a friend&lt;br>
Mother has not met for long.&lt;br>
A white window&lt;br>
A girl with hidden tears&lt;br>
Stars are falling outside&lt;br>
In a night of twinkle moonlight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the first comparison “Love is like a tale”, the composer half opens a world full of magic. But why does he compare love with tale? Maybe because tale is about miraculous world of kids and love is about the magic between parents. The magic of love connects and leads them to be a father and to be a mother. But in the story that the father has forgotten, may that magic just get faded?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next comparison is much more ordinary. Love is like a friend but “long time no see”, it’s unforgettable but so distant. We doubtfully understand that love between “father” and “mother” has not been fervid as before. The song’s melody also partly reveals that emotion’s disappearance, we find that when being set to music, the comma is transformed from text punctuation to a silent sound which is so fast but also motionless, a silent sound is enough for listeners to feel the pain of “a girl”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Le Quynh Tran continues to insert some details illustrating the real-life tragedy of that family to his music story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Behind each frosty word,&lt;br>
Time still flies.&lt;br>
Behind the happy smile,&lt;br>
Tears still fall when no one’s watching.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perhaps, the love between parents may not be so wonderful, instead, there are cold and apathetic words. All of those used to love so hard but they are now, with happy smiles on the outside, still blubbering when getting back home in lonely night. By song lyric, the composer also sends us a message about the love consolidation before time flies so fast and so far.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An empty house&lt;br>
A sleepless night like sorrows in winter nights&lt;br>
Or flowers are waiting for the spring to bloom.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The special story about a cold home of “the girl” is unveiled in a music space full of white color: “ô cửa trắng” (white window), “đêm trắng” (it means sleepless night, but “trắng” also means “white”). But why it is “đêm trắng”? We get used to the word “đêm trắng” (sleepless night) as a description of the sleeplessness in anxiety. But using the word “trắng đêm” (being sleepless for the whole night) to describe a girl’s sleeplessness seems too mature for her age. The word “đêm trắng” brings about purity and innocence but a little glumness and loneliness in frigid winter nights.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Le Quynh Tran always has subtly deep comparisons. He compares “đêm trắng” - a cold color with “sorrow” in winter nights - an emotion. With compact words, although not imagining the realistic white color of a sleepless night, we can partly feel for the unfortunate girl’s painful soul which is made by her lovers in her family.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Le Quynh Tran’s music really makes a special impression of a personal feeling in music lover’s hearts. It is sad but not suffocating, just vague and quite anxious.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Falling asleep, she is dreaming about being a swift flying in the mist,&lt;br>
Across the ocean&lt;br>
Flying to remote galaxy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With a kind heart, the composer doesn’t want “the innocent girl” to undergo the sadness when her house is not a home in the true sense of the word. He transforms her sorrow into a beautiful dream with little daisy waiting for the spring to bloom. In reality, we may not able to magic an obsessed sleepless night into happiness. However, the artist, with music in particular and art in general, can turn that into kid’s dreams looking alike folks told by the melody. That is a beautiful dream with swifts flying in the sky, across the boundless ocean, across verdant forests and interminable Mongolian grasslands and reach to the new region, where the girl would have both of a happy family and parent’s love. “White” tends to repel sadness, which seems like the story “The Little Match Girl” of Andersen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The adults in our challenging growth may lose the passionate love of the youth in our heart. The composer reminds us of the most careless and beautiful period when we still believed in that magic. Why do the parents really want to steal the happy-go-lucky world of their children?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last hidden intention of Quynh is to wake parental vocation in adults. He would like to send a message that for a kid, white should not be the color of sleepless nights or terrifying nightmares, instead, it should be the purity of “gentle dreams staying in the heart”. Images about “home”, “swifts” and “the spring” will be the representative of happiness, reunion and coziness of a family.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let the white&lt;br>
Like gentle dreams staying in the heart&lt;br>
And in the roof&lt;br>
Swifts are coming back with the spring.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The unfortunate children, living with the violence and curses, always have incurable pain in their soul caused by “white”. This can be compared with the most savage method of torture in the world: the white room. The common feature of both is to create psychological disorders that seem unrecoverable for the victims. So, when mentioning the white, we should think in different ways, because “the white” is not so innocent as we usually imagine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“White” is the song about children written for adults. Le Quynh Tran not only has comforted children’s heart but also has awakened parents’ love in a very subtle, deep and humane manner. In this way, he also sends a message about love and family affection to those responsible for bringing up a child. I hope that parents in similar situations can think thoroughly so that your children can have confidence, honesty, courage and resilience to face ups and downs in this life.&lt;/p>

Then everyone will look at our home: &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s lucky, it&amp;rsquo;s lucky &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; I don&amp;rsquo;t need that. I need to make myself worthy of the value of a person in the society. I think the next time if I was lucky, I would refuse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>🐔Why are you so foolish? You keep saying that. If so, you have to bring it back&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>🐷 No, I don&amp;rsquo;t need it. You should not need either. Because when I grow up, I will take care of your grandchildren, they have to become kind and proud persons. Speaking of themselves, when they reveal themselves to outsiders, they need be proud instead of hidden. They should be really proud of themselves instead of proving their pride. And although no one is proud of them, their parents can be proud of them.&lt;/p>

Shizuka embodies the ideal type of lover that every man desires. Specifically because she&amp;rsquo;s beautiful, has her own personality, a good education and is an excellent housewife. Why did a girl like that choose a clumsy like Nobita? In the meantime, she had many more options: perfect Dekisugi, rich Suneo and energetic Jaian? Could it be that Nobita has something more special than the others or is it because Shizuka really doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit the other three? Let&amp;rsquo;s analyze together!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;">The first and also the most formidable rival is Dekisugi. This boy presents a well-educated person with perfect virtue. Why is that? Because in all fields from studying, playing sports or relationships in life, Dekisugi does very well. (There are episodes that Nobita tried to demolish him but he still did not fall below the level of quite good) Shizuka liked Dekisugi, they also have many times going out together, doing homework&amp;hellip; so why didn&amp;rsquo;t she choose Dekisugi in the end? Surely anyone who has seen Doraemon can admit that it is very rare he joined group games with friends. Every time Shizuka is in danger, Nobita comes to the rescue. That&amp;rsquo;s enough for us to consider that Dekisugi - a perfect human model should only be a dream, worthy of idol, friendzone rather than a lover.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;">Next is the rich young-master Suneo. Rich background, Suneo has a life fulfilled with comfort, material. If Shizuka married Suneo, she would surely be a royal maid. Is that true? And does Shizuka like that kind of life? The answer is probably not. We easily see that due to the lack of familiarity in the family, when facing the danger, Suneo often chooses to escape and leave others. In addition, he is also boastful, very peachy and heavily dependent on his mother (each time he need help, he always calls his mother). Perhaps for all of that reasons, Shizuka put Suneo in friendzone. 😃&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;">The person with the most courage and strength in the group is Jaian. Talking about Jaian, we must talk about spirit. We often see that Jaian bullies his friends very easily. But that was probably due to the genes and habitat that shaped his personality. When confronted with danger, with events in life, do we realize the nature of him. It can be said that in dangerous adventures with the group, many times Jaian was the brave person who rushed into danger, led the team. When he parted aways with Nobita, he regretted everything he did or many times for his sister that he could do anything. Thereby, we can see that Jaian is a man who is an upright man, meaning but in a rude manner. The reason that Shizuka only considered Jaian as a friend was probably because of his personality. A gentle girl will surely not choose people who are too shocked and rude. 🙂&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;">And finally, it is Nobita Nobi. He has many shortcomings including: lazy, sleepy, bad at school, bad sports&amp;hellip; But is that all about Nobita&amp;rsquo;s people? The answer is definitely not :))) From the beginning, Nobita was always the most meaningful person. It is easy to see, in all of Doraemon&amp;rsquo;s long episodes, Nobita was always the one who saw through the inside of the supporting characters. He is always a personal talker, sympathetic to the supporting characters. This is a trait that the other 3 guys don&amp;rsquo;t have. Not only that, he&amp;rsquo;s also a very tolerant, tolerates person who bullies himself (there are times when he sought revenge, but compared to the number of times he was bullied, it&amp;rsquo;s not worth), tolerates each blade of grass. He is also very brave to protect the right, always trying his best to do something if he has made up his determination. Back to Nobita&amp;rsquo;s bad study, if we noticed that most of the problems were true and false, Nobita could choose all the wrong answers, this is not normal :)))&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;">We go back to Shizuka. She and Nobita have always been together in every adventure, growing up and growing together. Nobita was always a support for Shizuka whenever she was in trouble. (It is easy to understand, because no one can leave the person who makes her happy) It can be consider that Nobita is the present and the future that Shizuka should respect. Because of Nobita&amp;rsquo;s appearance, Shizuka becomes more perfect. Human psychology is very complex and accepting a person who makes silly harmless mistakes both helps us feel good and helps us accept the person who is defective in us. If staying with Dekisugi, Shizuka will forever be a shadow of herself, but going with Nobita, she is a true woman that thousands of people dream about. Love is complex, we don&amp;rsquo;t need the perfect person, the one we need the most is the right person to accompany us all the way of life. And maybe Shizuka chose the right one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ladies, have you chosen a Nobita for your life?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
