## Welcome

I am a PhD student in Machine Learning and Data Science at Northwestern University (expected graduation: December 2025). I focus on large language model (LLM) evaluation and alignment, synthetic data generation for underrepresented cases, and efficient large-scale training methods.

### Research Interests
- LLM evaluation and alignment
- Synthetic data generation for rare/long-tail conditions
- Efficient and scalable training (boosting, distributed optimization)
- Trustworthy and reliable AI

### Experience
- Stanford Trustworthy AI Research Lab — Visiting Student Researcher (Jun 2025–Present)
  - Built a cultural reasoning benchmark (80K+ prompts) integrated into the HELM Leaderboard across 25+ countries.
  - Fine-tuned LLMs with SFT and PPO to improve alignment on cultural reasoning tasks.
- Sabre Holdings — AI Engineer Intern (Sep 2025–Present)
  - Developed a multi-agent AI travel recommender combining search and purchase prediction APIs.
  - Automated user outreach via SendGrid for end-to-end flight recommendation delivery.
- Center for Deep Learning, Northwestern — Graduate Research Assistant (Jun 2024–May 2025)
  - Created a synthetic clinical data pipeline for rare ICD codes and fine-tuned LLMs for robust coding.
  - Designed efficient boosting strategies for CNN/Transformer ensembles to cut training cost while preserving accuracy.
- Mintel Group — Applied AI Intern (Sep 2024–May 2025)
  - Built an agentic RAG system with Pinecone to support deep F&B market analysis.
  - Delivered analytics agents for SQL querying and trend detection over 20 GB of GNPD data.

### Education
- Northwestern University — M.S. in Machine Learning and Data Science (GPA: 3.98/4.0), expected Dec 2025
- Drexel University — B.S. in Chemical Engineering (GPA: 3.77/4.0), Sep 2023; Students Tackling Advanced Research Scholars award
