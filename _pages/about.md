I am a Master's student in Machine Learning and Data Science at Northwestern University (expected graduation: December 2025) and a Visiting Student Researcher at Stanford's Trustworthy AI Research Lab, working with Professor Sanmi Koyejo.

My research focuses on developing **trustworthy and reliable large language models**, with particular interests in:
- Fine-grained evaluation frameworks for identifying strengths and limitations of LLMs
- Synthetic data generation to induce and refine desired model behaviors
- Efficient machine learning algorithms for large-scale model training and adaptation
