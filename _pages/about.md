I am a Master's student in Machine Learning and Data Science at Northwestern University, expected to graduate in December 2025. I am currently a Visiting Student Researcher at the Stanford Trustworthy AI Research Lab, working with Professor Sanmi Koyejo.

My research focuses on developing trustworthy and reliable large language models. I am particularly interested in:
- Developing fine-grained evaluation frameworks to identify the strengths and limitations of LLMs
- Exploring and generating synthetic data to induce and refine desired model behaviors
- Advancing efficient machine learning algorithms for large-scale model training and adaptation

Through this work, I seek to develop rigorous methodologies and scalable techniques that strengthen the reliability and trustworthiness of language models.

Research Experience
======
I have been fortunate to work on several research projects at the intersection of machine learning and natural language processing:

**Stanford Trustworthy AI Research Lab** (June 2025 - Present)
- Developing large-scale cultural reasoning benchmarks for evaluating LLMs
- Fine-tuning models using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning for improved alignment

**Northwestern University Center for Deep Learning** (June 2024 - May 2025)
- Building synthetic data pipelines for medical ICD coding
- Developing efficient training algorithms for CNN and Transformer ensembles
- Working on distributed optimization algorithms for large-scale machine learning

Industry Experience
======
I have also gained practical experience applying AI and machine learning in industry settings:

**Sabre Holdings** - AI Engineer Intern (September 2025 - Present)
- Developing multi-agent AI systems for personalized travel recommendations

**Mintel Group** - Applied AI Intern (September 2024 - May 2025)
- Built agentic RAG systems for market analytics
- Developed AI workflows for food & beverage market analysis
