This paper presents a novel framework for efficient optimization of CNN ensembles that integrates subgrid-boosted feature selection with boosting-inspired learning. The method introduces subgrid selection and importance sampling to emphasize statistically informative regions of the feature space, while embedding boosting weights directly into the ensemble training process through a least squares formulation.
